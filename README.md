# 2024 update to keep alive

Scripts that I have tested after updating all "http://" to "https://":

- Neopets_Bank_and_Till (defunct)
- Neopets_Battledome_Fight (works)
- Neopets_Dailies_To-Do (works)
- Neopets_Dice-A-Roo (works)
- Neopets_Food_Club (works)
- Neopets_Healing_Springs (works)
- Neopets_Quick_Price_Checker (works)
- Neopets_Shop_Wizard_Improved_Search (works)
